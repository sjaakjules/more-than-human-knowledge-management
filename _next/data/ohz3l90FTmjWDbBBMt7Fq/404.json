The ever-increasing amount of data humans gather about the planet is a common strategy for the assessment of the impact and the planning of remediation.

These organisms grow to become some of of the tallest and most massive organisms in the world, and are critically important habitats for many forms of life. Increasing bushfires due to climate change pose an ongoing existential threat. For instance, the 2018-2019 bushfire killed over 50% of Tasmania's trees over 90m and significantly injured many more. Due to the immense time-periods it takes for these trees to grow (500-700 years), experts say that we may never see such trees again.</p>\n<p>Mostly as a result of the work of local activists, new giant trees have been discovered and stands of them have been afforded protection due to their campaigns. Such work is needed as Tasmania's regnans forests are still logged. While trees over 85 meters are legislatively protected, large volume trees are not. Many of these trees are older and more massive than the tallest trees but may have lost some height due to lightning strikes and other environmental factors. Furthermore, this legislation does not protect younger <em>E. regnans</em> trees, threatening the next generation of giant trees. Activists, ecologists and others seek to document Tasmania's giant trees to increase their recognition and preserve information about these rapidly disappearing structures.</p>\n<p>Our ongoing research has collected high resolution data describing these and other large old trees and we learn ways to read their meaning. There are many challenges to collecting this data  due to the trees' size, structural complexity and remote locations.

We suggest that humans can only find answers to these questions through an approach that invites contributions not only from humans but also from birds, trees, and others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gap-integrating-more-than-human-knowledge-is-an-open-and-difficult-challenge\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gap-integrating-more-than-human-knowledge-is-an-open-and-difficult-challenge\"></a>Gap: Integrating More-than-human knowledge is an open and difficult challenge</h3>\n<p>Recent work emphasise that knowledge is better understood as clusters that are different, partial, problematic, and heterogenous.
