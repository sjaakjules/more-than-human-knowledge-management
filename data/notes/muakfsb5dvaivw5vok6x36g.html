<p>Our third character is a collapsed <em>Eucalyptus Regnans</em> tree, known as the Arve Giant. This tree was 500 years old and 87m tall when it burnt from the inside out in the 2019 Tasmanian bushfires. See the <a href="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/notes/s6jc46l6vvvetx9hoj0zfup">fire</a> event for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Australia’s island state of Tasmania, many of the world’s biggest flowering trees lie in ruins after this year’s bushfires. The Arve Giant, a eucalyptus regnans (“king of the eucalypts”), had attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors in recent decades, but it succumbed in January.</p>
<p>Before its fall, it was a contender for the world’s biggest flowering tree by volume at 360 cubic metres, which is roughly the equivalent volume of three Boeing 737-300s. “This tree was 87 metres tall. It had a circumference of 17.2 metres. Now it is just a crumpled mess,” said Pearce.</p>
