>A primary threatening process in temperate eucalypt woodlands is land clearing. Because the broad spatial distribution of temperate woodlands coincides strongly with the nation’s major wheat–sheep belts, much of the original vegetation cover has been cleared (Hobbs and Yates 2000). For example, only ~10% of temperate eucalypt woodlands with a grassy understorey remain uncleared in south-eastern Australia (Prober et al. 2012a). In the wheatbelt of Western Australia, ~90% of the vegetation – much of it temperate eucalypt wood- land – has been cleared (Gibson et al. 2004).[^1]

## Logging

#### Logging at the Styx. 

>STT (Sustainable Timbers Tasmania) is the custodian of the public forests and says it does not log trees taller than 85 metres or more than 280 cubic metres in volume. It lists some 150 such giants. However, the state premier, Will Hodgman, has authorised it to log stands of the next generation of the world’s tallest flowering trees. The younger giant eucalypts are being trucked out of the southern forests, which are among the world’s most carbon-dense forests. The national environment minister, Sussan Ley, backs the logging.

## Recognition

>There is little official documentation or recognition of Tasmanian giant trees. When Victorian-based big tree legend Brett Mifsud commenced Tasmanian giant tree searches in the 1990s, he found that information was sparse and mainly anecdotal. We all owe so much to Brett and his years of dedicated work.
>
>Forest conservation campaigns spearheaded by The Wilderness Society sparked the public interest in tall trees at Beech Creek near Wayatinah in the 1980s, and subsequently a decade later in the Styx Valley. Responding to the growing public attention, Forestry Tasmania, now rebranded as Sustainable Timber Tasmania, commissioned a survey in early 2000 to measure the heights of Tasmania’s tallest trees (Kostoglou 2000). At that time, height was the main criterion for recognition of exceptional trees. Kostoglou (2000) compiled historic reports of Tasmanian trees up to 101 m tall and noted that these were considerably shorter than estimates of Victorian tree heights in the 19th century. 
>
>The loftiest tree measured in the 2000 survey was 92 m tall — 1 m taller than the tallest existing, reliably reported Victorian tree — and therefore just sufficient for Tasmania to claim the world’s tallest hardwood at the time. The ten tallest Tasmanian trees then exceeded 85 m, and this apparently inspired Forestry Tasmania to set the threshold for giant tree protection in state forest at that height. The policy was revised to include trees of large volume in 2002, following the discovery of the 404 cubic metre El Grande, which had an impressive girth of 19 m, but at 79 m tall it would not have otherwise qualified for giant protection. Sadly El Grande was killed by Forestry Tasmania after they clearfell logged the surrounding old growth forest and fatally burnt the tree as part of a “regeneration burn”. 
>
>Largely due to the work of a few amateurs, the number of recognised giants has considerably increased in the past 20 years, and the tallest now known tree Centurion is 100.5m tall.

## Measurement

**Height**

>Tall trees are easy to find. State wide LiDar scans have created data sets that make it easy to see the height of trees and their emergence from the lower canopy. LiDar is a method of scanning a broad area with lasers to generate 3D spatial data that is accurate to the centimetre. 
>
>While it is possible to still find undocumented tall trees it is increasingly difficult to do so because to the abundance of LiDar scans. We have it of good authority that all trees over 85m have been visited and ground-truthed.

**Volume**

>Volumetric trees are very hard to find. This is the area of most interest to the new generation of Tasmanian big tree hunters. LiDar is unreliable at best in finding these trees because they are often at or below the surrounding canopy layer.
>
>These trees are often much older than the tall trees and as such have lost their height because of snapped out crown structures. However, they continue to grow outwards and draw down immense amounts of atmospheric carbon.
