<p><strong>Old mountain ash tree (Eucalyptus regnans), 200 left, with twelve of the largest twenty burnt in 2019</strong></p>
<p>This story is about a disappearing stage of life, and death.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus regnans trees live in Australia’s southern forests. Among frequent bushfires, they have evolved to die and grow quickly. In wet Tasmania the fires are rare. There, cool valleys are home to elders that live for hundreds of years. They are among the largest organisms on Earth. However, the climate is warming, and the forests are drying. The giants burn, fall, and die. Humans are not likely to ever see such trees again. The forest community will have no elders. See <a href="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/notes/9x6dfgsm5rbbovi57382wdb">Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Large old trees are homes to many beings and hold many stories. We show topographies that create wet conditions, stands of giant trees, individual living and dead trees and their neighbours, bark, moss, lichen, epiphytes and animals that live within them. To trace this story, we use computational analysis and artificial intelligence to probe the data acquired by <a href="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/notes/886yny3a798uqfcb5pgeydt">laser imaging</a> and <a href="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/notes/g7uhu97c55di49f6uqcmynf">radiation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What you see</strong> > Three giant trees: one living; one dead, still standing; one fallen; in the valleys of Tasmanian rainforests during the dying days of the Holocene.
<strong>Who speaks</strong> > 400-year old Eucalyptus regnans trees (mountain ash, swamp gum, stringy bark, giant gum), first seen by humans some 60,000 years ago, distinct as the Eucalypteae tribe for some 60 million years; the tallest flowering plants on Earth. See <a href="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/notes/m9h7f2cvjdev0t4bnk908kg">Uniqueness</a>.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “Expecting death at any moment, we grow quickly. In wet, cool places, we remain undisturbed. Here, we live for hundreds of years. Now we are elders. Yet, the forest is changing. Fires burn stronger and more often. Many elders have fallen.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-005.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > A stand of remnant giants, coloured, hundreds of years old, growing in the Styx valley, an area with tolerable disturbances.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “The hills make clouds drip. Moss and lichens line the gullies. Ferns, sassafras and myrtle shade the ground. In these cool, wet places, we grow above others.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-006.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > An elder tree (blue, left) in a forest clearing saved from wood harvesting, soil disturbance or forest segmentation; three views of a bark fragment and its inhabitants.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “We live together with many others. We steady the climate. Our branches host ferns, epiphytes, fungi and lichens. We control water and soil, feed birds, and shelter the smallest of creatures.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-007.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > A state of a recently burnt valley, six months after the 2019 bushfires. A dead standing elder, orange, middle; remnants of a burnt tree, blue, right, combined with data overlay that shows the outlines of previously existing trees and their foliage, green.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “When dead, we stand tall, a home to many. We still feed the others after we fall.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-008.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > A decaying elder in a wet sclerophyll forest. A giant hollow, green; bigger than an average room and full of multispecies life.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “We decay as we live, such is our way. We rot to give back. In this way we live long, beyond your lives and your civilisations.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-009.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > The main ring of the particle accelerator at the Australian Synchrotron. Trees are too large for most volumetric-imaging devices, so we used the high-powered beam of this machine instead.</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-010.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > The size of a living tree and a relatively small limb that is as large as a human body held by a robot arm for the synchrotron scanning, left and centre; synchotron beam at work behind an observation window, upper right; the laser scanner on a rural road, bottom right.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “After we are gone, these landscapes may never see the likes of us again.”</p>
<p><img src="/more-than-human-knowledge-management/assets/images/SIGGRAPH-Images/Last-Of-Their-Kind-011.png"></p>
<p><strong>What you see</strong> > Plant features, recognised and quantified with imaging and artificial intelligence techniques.
<strong>What the elders say</strong> > “What will remain when we are gone?”</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx","title":"The Last Elders","desc":"","updated":1644203506532,"created":1642491638223,"custom":{},"fname":"exhibitions.the-last-of-their-kind.elders","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"megaflora","remote":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/sjaakjules/megaflora"},"name":"megaflora"},"contentHash":"a5c7aba4d60b9abd6c1fd0931f213eb6","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"exhibitions.the-last-of-their-kind.elders","id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx","vaultName":"megaflora"},"value":"stories.uncertainty","alias":"stories.uncertainty","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":479,"offset":650},"end":{"line":8,"column":502,"offset":673},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"stories.uncertainty"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"exhibitions.the-last-of-their-kind.elders","id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx","vaultName":"megaflora"},"value":"methods.surface-imaging","alias":"laser imaging","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":366,"offset":1040},"end":{"line":10,"column":407,"offset":1081},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"methods.surface-imaging"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"exhibitions.the-last-of-their-kind.elders","id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx","vaultName":"megaflora"},"value":"methods.tomography","alias":"radiation","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":412,"offset":1086},"end":{"line":10,"column":444,"offset":1118},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"methods.tomography"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"exhibitions.the-last-of-their-kind.elders","id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx","vaultName":"megaflora"},"value":"stories.uniqueness","alias":"stories.uniqueness","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":256,"offset":1606},"end":{"line":15,"column":278,"offset":1628},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"stories.uniqueness"}}],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"4nkxzqR8shWh8cxilfBD0","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-last-elders\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-last-elders\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe Last Elders\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOld mountain ash tree (Eucalyptus regnans), 200 left, with twelve of the largest twenty burnt in 2019\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is about a disappearing stage of life, and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEucalyptus regnans trees live in Australia’s southern forests.

The ever-increasing amount of data humans gather about the planet is a common strategy for the assessment of the impact and the planning of remediation. Our research seeks to expand the notion of knowledge management to include nonhuman lifeforms as empowered contributors to collective storytelling. We argue that this redefinition of data, storytelling and knowledge is necessary in the era where human-centred approaches fail to address ecological devastation.\n\nOne example is giant *E. regnans* trees in Tasmania. These organisms grow to become some of of the tallest and most massive organisms in the world, and are critically important habitats for many forms of life. Increasing bushfires due to climate change pose an ongoing existential threat. For instance, the 2018-2019 bushfire killed over 50% of Tasmania's trees over 90m and significantly injured many more. Due to the immense time-periods it takes for these trees to grow (500-700 years), experts say that we may never see such trees again.\n\nMostly as a result of the work of local activists, new giant trees have been discovered and stands of them have been afforded protection due to their campaigns. Such work is needed as Tasmania's regnans forests are still logged. While trees over 85 meters are legislatively protected, large volume trees are not. Many of these trees are older and more massive than the tallest trees but may have lost some height due to lightning strikes and other environmental factors. Furthermore, this legislation does not protect younger *E. regnans* trees, threatening the next generation of giant trees. Activists, ecologists and others seek to document Tasmania's giant trees to increase their recognition and preserve information about these rapidly disappearing structures.\n\nOur ongoing research has collected high resolution data describing these and other large old trees and we learn ways to read their meaning. There are many challenges to collecting this data  due to the trees' size, structural complexity and remote locations. Furthermore, understanding meaning is an open and difficult challenge because elements of ecosystems mean different things to different inhabitants. We suggest that humans can only find answers to these questions through an approach that invites contributions not only from humans but also from birds, trees, and others.\n\n### Gap: Integrating More-than-human knowledge is an open and difficult challenge\n\nRecent work emphasise that knowledge is better understood as clusters that are different, partial, problematic, and heterogenous. For instance, researchers increasingly understand the interdisciplinary nature (crossing scientific disciplines, crossing into the humanities, etc) of environmental challenges. Further research acknowledges the benefits of integrating the diverse forms ecological knowledge can take. For instance, knowledge about ecological management can take the form of formal scientific hypothesis-testing but is also retained and expressed in longer periods of time through practices such as indigenous story-telling and other cultural memories.\n\nThe next step is recognising that  clusters of knowledge are not limited to humans. Nonhumans have forms of knowledge too. Traces of these clusters -- or knowledge objects -- are expressed in genes, patterns of behaviour, and nonhuman cultures. The differences can be large due to different evolutionary backgrounds, life histories, mutual (in)visibilities, and the inherently incompatible needs of different lifeforms.\n\n### Research Question\n\nHow can more-than-human knowledge be organised and expressed to maximise inclusivity about nonhuman places and lifeforms?\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nTechnologically amplified stories can help to capture, make inclusive and communicate human and more-than-human forms of knowledge.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"publishing":{"copyAssets":true,"theme":"light","siteIndex":"root","siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","enablePrettyRefs":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enableKatex":true,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enableHierarchyDisplay":true,"hierarchyDisplayTitle":"Childrens","writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"More-than-Human Knowledge Management","description":"Ongoing research by Deep Design Lab.","author":"Deep Design Lab"},"github":{"editBranch":"main","enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editViewMode":"tree"},"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["megaflora"]},"assetsPrefix":"/more-than-human-knowledge-management","siteUrl":"https://sjaakjules.github.io","logoPath":"megaflora/assets/images/logo.png","hierarchy":{"root":{"publishByDefault":true},"tags":{"publishByDefault":false},"themes":{"publishByDefault":false},"project-structure":{"publishByDefault":false},"wip":{"publishByDefault":false}},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico"},"commands":{"copyNoteLink":{"nonNoteFile":{"anchorType":"block"},"aliasMode":"title"},"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":true,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"vaults":[{"fsPath":"megaflora","remote":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/sjaakjules/megaflora"},"name":"megaflora"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"taskCompleteStatus":["x","done"],"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"createStub":true,"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableSmartRefs":false,"dendronVersion":"0.84.0"},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"wnj75m8odm2t6sd3f2oiskx"},"buildId":"ohz3l90FTmjWDbBBMt7Fq","assetPrefix":"/more-than-human-knowledge-management","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
